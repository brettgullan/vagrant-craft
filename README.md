Vagrant + Craft CMS
===================

A puppet provisioned Vagrant development server for Craft CMS projects. 
It uses the standard Vagrant Ubuntu Trusty64 base box `ubuntu/trusty64.box`.

**Please note: This is intended for development purposes only.**

What do you get?
----------------

The latest versions of:

* Nginx (ppa:nginx/stable)
* PHP-FPM (ppa:ondrej/php7)
* phpMyAdmin
* MySQL

**Tested on Vagrant 1.6.2.**

Usage
=====

First you need to install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo into a `vagrant` folder at the root of your project.  So it's sitting alongside your `public`, `craft`, etc. folders:

		git clone https://github.com/brettgullan/vagrant-craft.git vagrant

2. Grab the sub-modules:

		cd vagrant && git submodule update --init

3. Make a logs directory within the Vagrant folder (PHP errors will be put here):

		mkdir logs

4. Move the Vagrantfile to the root of your project:

		mv .Vagrantfile ../Vagrantfile

5. Install the vagrant-cachier plug-in (this makes provisioning boxes from scratch way faster):

		cd .. && vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

6. Get started (first run this takes 10 minutes after that about 3 minutes - thanks to `vagrant-cachier`:

		vagrant up

7. Restore your DB using phpMyAdmin by going to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) (you'll be logged-in automatically).

8. Access your website at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and get to work!

You can use your hosts file to point [http://craft.dev:8080/](http://craft.dev:8080/) or any domain you fancy at the site.

Important notes and troubleshooting
===================================

1. Running `vagrant destroy` is the virtual equivalent of throwing a computer out of the window so make sure you have a DB back-up first!

2. Make sure your Craft database credentials are set correctly, e.g.:

		'.local' => array(
			'server'      => 'localhost',
			'user'        => 'root',
			'password'    => 'password',
			'database'    => 'DATABASE NAME HERE',
			'tablePrefix' => 'craft'
		)

3. For performance reasons the `craft/storage/runtime` folder is excluded from the Vagrant synced folder.  As Craft writes a lot of log entries here this has a major impact on the VM performance (particularly on Windows).  So excluding the folder makes the site run a LOT quicker but remember you need to `vagrant ssh` onto the VM to access the `craft.log` file.

4. In the Vagrantfile on lines 21 and 22 you may need to adjust the memory and CPU settings for the VM.

5. Using the `precise64.box` assumes you are running a 64-bit OS. I haven't tried but I assume you can switch to `precise32.box` if necessary (lines 10 and 11 of the Vagrantfile).

6. You can un-comment line 20 in the Vagrantfile so that Virtualbox will launch a GUI so you can see the console for the VM as it launches for troubleshooting.

7. The Nginx virtual host file assumes you are serving Craft from a folder called `public` within the root of your project, if that's not the case it can be edited in the file `/files/nginx/sites-available/default` at line 5.

8. The server name that is presented to Craft CMS is "vagrant.local". This can be changed on line ~4 of the file `/files/nginx/sites-available/default` so it matches your multi-environment config.

Nginx
-----

This is pre-configured to work with PHP-FPM and includes a Craft CMS friendly virtual host file and also another for phpMyAdmin.

The Craft CMS virtual host file includes some development friendly cache expiry settings too.

MySQL
-----

The root password is "password".

phpMyAdmin
----------

This is accessible at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) and will auto-login.

Log file location
-----------------

All Nginx and PHP-FPM log files are written to the `/logs/` folder.

As mentioned above the `craft/storage/runtime` folder is not synced so you need to `vagrant ssh` into the VM to view the `craft.log` stored there.

Craft CMS not included!
-----------------------

This doesn't actually include Craft CMS! Sorry, it's intended to be dropped *into* your Craft CMS project.
